Personal website (WIP)

## Local development

Run `npm run dev` to start up a webpack dev server hosting the React app at localhost:9000

## Building and deploying

Run `npm run deploy` which webpacks the app into the `build` folder and then publishes those files to the `gh-pages` branch.
After a few minutes the updated files should be available at [bsiaotickchong.github.io](https://bsiaotickchong.github.io).
